## Key takeaways 
- I study the effects of retirement on wellbeing using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design that exploits institutional rules surrounding access to pension funds in Malaysia. 
- Using Wave 1 of the Malaysian Ageing and Retirement Survey (MARS), I find that retirement has a significant and positive effect on total, mental, and social wellbeing. My estimates suggest that individuals who are induced to retire experience wellbeing improvements that exceed the magnitudes typically associated with major life events such as the birth of a first child or marriage as reported in the existing life satisfaction literature. 
- I also find that the retirement-wellbeing link is heterogeneous across individuals with different socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Individuals with lower education, assets, or chronically ill experience lower or negative wellbeing gains after retirement.
