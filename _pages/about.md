I am an economic policy researcher and practitoner based in KL, Malaysia with more than 8 years of experience in policy research, economics, and consulting. I am driven to find answers to difficult policy questions.

**Current**
Currently a research fellow at the Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) Malaysia. I lead the economic research work to inform and influence evidence-based policymaking. I have consulted for federal and state governments on policy projects, collaborated with multinational development institutions on research, and worked with civil society organizations on the ground. I hold a Master’s degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and a Bachelor’s degree from Monash University Clayton. 

**Research interests**
My research primarily explores economic growth, labor markets, and social assistance program design. I've recently examined how the Covid-19 crisis unequally affected Malaysia's labor market and the economic strategies adopted regionally in response. My past research covers a spectrum of issues from the US-China trade conflict's impact on the Asia-Pacific to the structuring of Malaysia's BPR/BSH cash transfer program. My findings have been featured in international journals like the NBR's Asia Policy and showcased on news platforms such as the East Asia Forum and Malaysiakini.

**Research and consulting experience**
I have consulted for the World Bank, Federal and State governments, multinationational organisations like Google on numerous projects from strategy and policy design, to data collection and analysis, to local implementation and evaluation.
