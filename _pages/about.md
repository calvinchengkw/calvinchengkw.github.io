Hello! I am an economic policy researcher using data to tackle issues in public policy and economics. I am a currently a Fellow in the Economics programme at the <a href="https://www.isis.org.my/author/calvin">Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) Malaysia</a>, where I also lead the Institute's Economics research work. I hold a MSc in Public Policy from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and a B.Econ in Economics and Econometrics from Monash University in Clayton. 

My research focuses on policy issues in applied economics, particularly those related to jobs, labor markets, social protection, and economic development. Additionally, I am interested in the design considerations and incentive mechanisms of public policies. My research has been published in the National Bureau of Research (NBR) Asia Policy, the Japan Economic Foundation's Spotlight journal, and in two book chapters addressing the socio-economic and labor market effects of Covid-19 in Malaysia. My work and comments have featured in international media outlets such as Forbes, Al Jazeera, and Nikkei Asia. I have consulted for federal and state governments, international organizations including the World Bank, and multinational corporations like Google LLC.
