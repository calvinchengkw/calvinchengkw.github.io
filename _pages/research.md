Hello! I am an economic policy researcher with more than 8 years of experience in policy research, economics, and consulting. I am interested in using data to find answers to difficult policy questions -- along with the policy design aspects of policies. I am a Fellow in the Economics programme at the <a href="https://www.isis.org my">Institute of Strategic and International Studies Malaysia</a>, where I also lead the research work related to Economics. 

I did my MSc in Public Policy in the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) and my B.Econ in Economics and Econometrics from Monash University in Clayton. My <a href="https://www.isis.org my/author/calvin">research interests</a> explores economic policy issues related to labour markets, social protection, and economic development. I am particularly interested in XXX. I have also consulted for and/or worked with federal and state governments, international development organisations like the World Bank, and multinational firms like Google LLC.

My research has been published in the National Bureau of Research (NBR) Asia Policy, the Japan Economic Foundation's Spotlight journal, as well as in two books related to the socio-economic and labour market impacts of Covid-19 in Malaysia. My work has been featured on local and international news platforms like Forbes, Al Jazeera, and Nikkei Asia.
