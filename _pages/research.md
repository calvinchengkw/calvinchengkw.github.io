My research focuses on economic policy issues, particularly those related to jobs, labor markets, social protection, and economic development. I am also interested in the design considerations and incentive mechanisms of public policy instruments -- such as social transfer targeting and design, and fiscal policy design. 

Over the past few years, I have written two book chapters on the unequal impacts of Covid-19 on Malaysia's workers and labour market landscape

Fiscal policy of Covid


During my time in the LSE, I have also done work on Retirement and Targeting of social transfers

Currently, I am now working on two major research work areas:
▶ Labour policy related issues, including minimum wage, other labour market institutions and progressive wage model
▶ Economics of gender and care economy 
▶ Retirement using MARS Wave 2 data
