I am a public policy researcher interested in issues in applied economics, encompassing topics related to jobs, labor markets, social protection, and economic development. I am also interested in the design and incentive mechanisms of public policy instruments, with a special focus on transfer and benefit programs, taxation, and pensions.

Selected areas: 

### ▶ Economic and social impacts of crises 

Over the Covid-19 pandemic, I analysed the varied and wide-ranging <a href="https://www.isis.org.my/2023/11/01/post-covid-19-recovery-and-quest-for-good-jobs/">impacts</a> Covid-19 had on Malaysia's <a href="https://www.isis.org.my/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Calvin-Cheng-Socioeconomic-impacts-of-Covid-19-and-Malaysia.pdf">economy</a>, workers, and society -- including the vastly unequal <a href="https://www.isis.org.my/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/PUSHED-TO-THE-MARGIN-POLICY-BRIEF.pdf">labour market impacts</a> of containment measures on disadvantaged demographics, and its <a href="https://www.isis.org.my/2022/04/20/crisis-of-inequality-covid-19s-long-lasting-economic-impacts/">long-lasting consequences</a> for Malaysia's inequality and development. Part of this work has also involved documenting regional <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/846877/summary">economic responses</a> to the pandemic and evaluating the <a href="https://www.isis.org.my/2021/06/01/fiscal-size-matters-pt-2-permerkasa-plus-and-malaysias-economic-stimulus-packages/">design and effectiveness</a> of Malaysia's economic stimulus measures.

### ▶ Social protection, benefit and transfer programmes

I have worked on the <a href="https://www.isis.org.my/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Bantuan-Sara-Hidup-Design-Considerations-fina.pdf">policy design considerations</a> of Malaysia's unconditional cash transfer programme (currently Sumbangan Tunai Rahmah, previously variously named BR1M, BSH, BPN) since 2018. This includes design aspects related to beneficiary <a href="https://www.isis.org.my/2018/09/13/making-br1m-work/">targeting,</a> coverage, benefit adequacy, and implementation of both the flagship transfer programme, as well as the <a href="https://www.isis.org.my/2020/04/02/evaluating-the-bpn-bsh-cash-transfers-in-the-%e2%80%8bprihatin%e2%80%8b-stimulus-package/">"crisis"</a> measures introduced in economic stimulus measures in 2020-2021.

During my time as the London School of Economics throughout 2022-2023, I wrote on a Labour Economics extended essay (thesis) on "The causal effect of retirement on wellbeing in Malaysia: a regression discontinuity approach", using Wave 1 data from the  Malaysian Ageing and Retirement Survey (MARS). I also consulted with the World Bank Social Protection and Jobs Global Practice on a project on "Index-linking social transfers to safeguard vulnerable communities in times of economic uncertainy". This work was also presented at a World Bank SSN-GSG <a href="https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/index.php/extwidget/preview/partner_id/1930181/uiconf_id/29317392/entry_id/1_ddedyz6l/embed/dynamic">Brown Bag Lunch</a>, and I am now working on a follow-up extension of that project with the Bank. 

### ▶ In 2024, I am currently working on... 
* ...labour policy related issues, including on the design of the proposed Progressive Wage Model in Malaysia, wages, and wage floors
* ...retirement and ageing related issues, in particularly extending my retirement and wellbeing work using the newly released MARS Wave 2 dataset
* ...issues related to the economics of care, and gender gaps in Malaysia
