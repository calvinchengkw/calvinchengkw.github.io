My research focuses on economic policy issues, particularly those related to jobs, labor markets, social protection, and economic development. I am also interested in taxation and the policy design and incentive mechanisms, and implementation of cash transfer and social protection programmes -- including targeting, transfer modalities, index-linking, and 'trigger' mechanisms. Here are some selected thematic areas that I've recently worked in:

### ▶ Covid-19 stuff, jobs, labour markets 

Over the past few years during the Covid-19 pandemic, I did work on the unequal impacts of Covid-19 on Malaysia's workers and its socio-economic impacts, including on fiscal stimulus, measures as well as regional responses to the pandemic. This includes two book chapters, one in collaboration with TalentCorp and featured on the Human Resources Minister's top books for 2023 list -- and one forthcoming in press (see in-text links).

### ▶ Social benefits, cash transfer programming, design of social transfer programmes

During my time in LSE throughout 2022 and 2023, I have also worked on 1. causal effect of retirement on wellbeing: a regression discontinuity approach and 2. policy memo on the policy design of targeting social transfers, and 3. produced a capstone project on "Index-linking social trasnfers to safeguard vulnerable communities in times of economic uncertainty" which also led to both a SSN GSG BBL (https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/index.php/extwidget/preview/partner_id/1930181/uiconf_id/29317392/entry_id/1_ddedyz6l/embed/dynamic) and eventually a consulting project with the World Bank SPJ GP. 

### ▶ Retirement, ageing, gender, care

Currently, I am now working on two major research work areas:
* Labour policy related issues, including minimum wage, other labour market institutions and progressive wage model
* Economics of gender and care economy
* Retirement using MARS Wave 2 data

### ▶ Currently working on... 
* ...labour policy related issues, including on the design of the proposed Progressive Wage Model in Malaysia, as well as on a planned evaluation of the 2022 minimum wage increase
* ...Retirement and ageing related issues using the MARS Wave 2 dataset
* ...issues related to the economics of gender, gender gaps in Malaysia
