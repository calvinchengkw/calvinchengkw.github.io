 "How will the rapid adoption of generative AI technologies affect Malaysia's future of work?" 

The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of generative AI technologies make it uniquely disruptive, reigniting concerns about how AI will automate tasks and replace human jobs â€” despite its promise of bringing significant productivity gains.

In a PRAXIS 2024 Research Session I had the opportunity to present background preliminary research from ISIS Malaysia's project on "AI and Malaysia's future of work". During the panel session, we explored how Malaysia can navigate these AI-driven changes, focusing on strategies to bridge the gaps between policy, industry, and education, while arresting its potential impacts on inequality and social progress. 

Panel speakers: Alyssa Jasmin from the World Bank, Jasmine Begum from Microsoft, Thomas Mathew from TalentCorp Group and Mohd Khairi Man from the Malaysian Trades Union Congress (MTUC).
